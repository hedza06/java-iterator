# Java Iterators
Project demonstrates use of custom made iterators in Java programming language.
An Iterator is one of many ways we can traverse a collection.

## Iterator history
Iterators were first introduced in Java 1.2 as a replacement of Enumerations and:
- introduced improved method names
- made it possible to remove elements from a collection we're iterating over
- doesn't guarantee iteration order

## Limitations of iterator
- Only forward direction iterating is possible
- Replacement and addition of new element is not supported by Iterator

## Source code hints
In this demo you can find the universal custom list iterator that can iterate through many types of data. 
Test code is placed in file **IteratorMain.java**.
